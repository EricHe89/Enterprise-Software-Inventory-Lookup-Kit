# Enterprise-Software-Inventory-Lookup-Kit
# This is an PowerShell task automation script. It's useful when comparing 2 seperate Excel speadsheets for common items, often an ubiquitous situation in enterprise IT or business environment. The user can also either single-copy and multiple-copy spreadsheet entries between each other without opening the Excel sheets at all. All 6 functions are coded in 1 scirpt. Please make sure the spreadsheets are saved and exported into .txt files in the same directory when the script is stored. If you are in an enterprise environment, admin priviledge for PowerShell can be bypassed using "PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" command. You can load the script directly from local directory using the .\main.ps1 command in PowerShell.
